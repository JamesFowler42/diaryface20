Diary Face
==========

This is a simple digital watchface for use with Max BÃ¤umle's Smartwatch Pro.

It provides calendar alerts for events with a time in the current day. The watch will vibrate twice and turn the light on. 15 seconds later it will vibrate and light again. The event is shown with location and a relative time (e.g. In 15 mins).

When not showing an alert the watch face shows the next 5 calendar events in rotation. The time of the event is turned from a simple date into an easier to read 'today', 'tomorrow', 'Tuesday' or, if sufficiently far in the future the date as month name and day. The events are shown for 3 seconds each during the day and 10 seconds each overnight to save power.

The iPhone battery status is shown giving a level and, if on charge, a charging indicator.

There are three indicators showing communication from Pebble to iPhone, iPhone to Pebble and whether an alert has been set. 

I RECOMMEND REMOVING OTHER WATCHFACES USING SMARTWATCH PRO BEFORE INSTALLING. E.G. MODERN CALENDAR.
