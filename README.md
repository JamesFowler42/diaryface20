Diary Face 2.0
==============

This is a simple digital watchface for use with Max BÃ¤umle's Smartwatch Pro.

The watch face shows the next 5 calendar events in rotation. The time of the event is turned from a simple date into an easier to read 'today', 'tomorrow', 'Tuesday' or, if sufficiently far in the future the date as month name and day. If the watch detects movement the events change every 3 seconds but this gradually slows down to 30 seconds per change to save battery.

The status bar shows the event being shown (1-5), an indication of communcation with your iPhone (top arrow is a request, bottom arrow a reply), the phone battery state and the Pebble battery state.

A very violent movement of your wrist (clapping isn't enough during my tests) will sound the "find my iphone".
